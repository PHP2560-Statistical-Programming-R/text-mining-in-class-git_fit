Can't think of a data source?\n\n- `gutenbergr`\n- `AssociatedPress` from the `topicmodels` package\n- `NYTimes` or `USCongress` from the `RTextTools` package\n- Harry Potter Complete 7 Books text\n    ```\n    if (packageVersion(\"devtools\") < 1.6) {\n  install.packages(\"devtools\")\n}\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"bradleyboehmke/harrypotter\")\n    ```\n- [State of the Union speeches](https://pradeepadhokshaja.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/scraping-the-web-for-presdential-inaugural-addresses-using-rvest/)\n- Scrape tweets using [`twitteR`](https://www.credera.com/blog/business-intelligence/twitter-analytics-using-r-part-1-extract-tweets/)\n\nAnalyze the text for sentiment OR topic. **You do not need to do both**. The datacamp courses and [Tidy Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/) are good starting points for templates to perform this type of analysis, but feel free to *expand beyond these examples*.\n\n# Timelines and Task\n\n\nWe will spend the next 2 weeks working on analyzing textual data in R. You will do the following:\n\n- Start with some text based data.\n- Clean data and prepare it for analysis\n- Ask questions about the data\n- Answer these questions with the data using tables and graphics\n- Each group member must have their own unique question that they code the answer for. \n\n",
